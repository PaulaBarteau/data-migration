# data-migration
Repository to manage migration of data for incoming collections.

Activity in this repository will be intiated once a new collection has finalized and signed an MOU and collection portals have been created.

Projects will be used to manage data migration of each collection.

Please do not change tasks in the Data Migration Template Project unless a change to the process is being recorded. Tasks in this project should be copied into a new project for each incoming collection.
