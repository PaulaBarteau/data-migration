# Data Migration

This repository is used to manage migration of data for incoming collections.

Activity in this repository will be intiated once a new collection has finalized and signed an MOU and collection portals have been created through a project in the [New Collections repository](https://github.com/ArctosDB/new-collections)

Projects will be used to manage data migration of each collection.

Please do not change tasks in the [Data Migration Template Project](https://github.com/ArctosDB/data-migration/projects/1) unless a change to the process is being recorded. Tasks in this project should be copied into a new project for each incoming collection. **DO NOT** turn the notes in the template into issues!
