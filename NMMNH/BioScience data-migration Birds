The Bird database has several problem records. The decisions below are what was decided in order to move forward transfer from MS Access into Arctos

Dates:
        Unknown dates use 1800-01-01; the current date will be used as the end date
        If there is a prep date, we use the prep date for the end date.
        If a year is provided, we use year-01-01 to year-31-12
        If a year and month are provided we use yyyy-mm-01 to the last day of that month
	
	Identification Date: does not require full date

Errors
        If you make an entry error, page will turn red/pink
        If you correct and save, it turns blue
                Which means you are just editing, so you need to go back to data entry in the Enter Data tab at top of page
        When it works, page stays green, you are still in data entry and can go on to next bird.
