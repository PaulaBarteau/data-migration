### Arctos Community Resources Created
 - 530 Paleo Agent names

### Arctos Procedures Created/Refined
 - Worked with Arctos programmer to create a new method for encumbering all locality data.
 - Tested bulkload of research localities and collecting events with Arctos programmer.

### Arctos Documentation Written
 - wrote [How To Create a Locality](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Create-a-Locality.html)
 - wrote [How to Encumber Locality Data](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Encumber-Locality.html)
 
 ### In Process
  - 2,430 Quad maps are being added as higher geography via a bulk process. We have gathered the necessary data for 1,065
  - 2,294 Taxa need to be researched and either corrected before loading to Arctos, or created in Arctos
  - 200 Arthropod taxonomy to be researched, updated and loaded/created into Arctos
  - Invertebrate/mollusc records 
  - [How To Add Geology Attributes to a Locality](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Add-Geology-Attributes-to-a-Locality.html)
  - Creating Tweets for BioSci @NMMNHS_Bio (Mollusc Monday, Mammal Monday) and Paleo (Fossil Friday) Twitter feeds and organizing with museum social media
