# New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Collections Digitization Project Update
### December, 2019

The New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science received funding for this project in July 2019. We immediately initiated work on four tasks 1) beginning the hiring process for two interns and one digitization technician, 2) re-quoting and ordering computer equipment, 3) mapping out data transfer to the Arctos database, and 4) uploading accession records into Arctos. 

During August and September, the collections managers transferred accessions to the new database. These records are essential because they track museum role as the legal caretaker of all specimens. We added all Bioscience accessions (284) and the most critical Geoscience accessions (213). We also mapped out key data infrastructures that improved efficiency for migration to the new database. The Bioscience collections manager finished this task quickly with the help of volunteers and was able to upload some taxonomy and higher geography before the new staff started. Mapping out the data migration was a more involved process for the Paleontology collection because we are the first large paleontology collection to move into Arctos. Importantly, this step will be rewarding because it will enable future paleontology collections efficient migration into Arctos. During September and October we continued to create new protocols and data structures for fossil specimens in Arctos.

Despite beginning the process in July, we experienced several delays with state government HR, but fortunately, we were able to start the new staff and install the new computer equipment by October. The new staff and equipment allowed us to begin the time-consuming process of cleaning data. Some examples of data cleaning tasks include validating every data field in every specimen record (spelling, agents, taxonomy, higher geography, etc.) and linking data across fields. Bioscience has completed uploading all birds and plants into Arctos and is finishing reptiles, amphibians, insects, invertebrates, molluscs, and mammals. Because the paleontology collection is larger and is not subdivided, we are taking a different approach. We have added 462 records as a test case to make sure our data mapping protocols are working correctly. Now, we are working on creating bulk upload files (1000â€™s of records each) as we clean the data. Across the paleontology collections, we have cleaned approximately 60% of both the 80,901 specimen records and 12,344 locality records.

We anticipate data migration to be 90% complete by late January and we plan to begin working on developing protocols for photographing and 3D scanning specimens. We have purchased all imaging equipment, which will begin arriving in December and early January. We will set up the equipment in January and start taking images soon after.
