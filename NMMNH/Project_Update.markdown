# New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Collections Digitization Project Update
## November, 2019

The New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science recived funding for this project in July 2019. We immediately initiated work on four tasks 1) beginning the hiring paperwork for two interns and one digitization technician, 2) requoting and ordering computer equipment, 3) mapping out the database transfer, and 4) uploading accession records into the new database.

During August and September, the collections managers transferred accessions to the new database. These are important records that document when and from whom the museum aquired specimens and show that the museum is the legal caretaker of all our specimens. We added all 284 of the biology accessions and 213 of the most critical geoscience accessions. In this time we were also able to map out how the data fields would be migrated to the new database. The Biology collections manager finished this task quickly, and with the help of volunteers, was able to upload some taxonomy and higher geography before the new staff even started. Mapping out the data migration was more complicated for the Paleontology collection because we are the first large paleontology collection to move into Arctos. During September and October we created new protocols and data structures for fossil specimens in Arctos.

Although we experienced a delay getting paperwork through state government, we were able to start the new staff and install the new computer equipment by October. The new staff and equipment allowed us to begin the time-consuming process of cleaning data. Some examples of data cleaning tasks are making sure every single field in every single record is spelled correctly and making sure that all species names are valid. As we clean our information we add shared data like people's names, maps, and species names to Arctos. We have also been able to start adding catalog records and localities to Arctos. Biology has completed adding birds and plants to Arctos and is working on reptiles, amphibians, insects, invertebrates, molluscs and mammals. Because the paleontology collection is so large and is not subdivided, we are taking a different approach. We have added 462 records as a test case to make sure our data mappping protocols are working correctly. Now, we are working on creating bulk upload files as we clean the data. We have cleaned approximately 60% of our specimen and locality data.

While we are finishing up our data migration this winter, we will begin working on developing protocols for photographing and 3D scanning specimens. We have purchased the imaging equipment, which will begin arriving in December and January. We will set up the equipment in January and start taking images right away.

### Arctos Procedures Created/Refined
 - Worked with Arctos programmer to create a new method for encumbering all locality data.
 - Tested bulkload of research localities and collecting events with Arctos programmer.

### Arctos Documentation Written
 - wrote [How To Create a Locality](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Create-a-Locality.html)
 - wrote [How to Encumber Locality Data](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Encumber-Locality.html)
 
 ### In Process
  - 2,430 Quad maps are being added as higher geography via a bulk process. We have gathered the necessary data for 1,065
  - 2,294 Taxa need to be researched and either corrected before loading to Arctos, or created in Arctos
  - 200 Biology Arthropod taxonomy to be researched, updated and loaded/created into Arctos
  - Invertebrate/mollusc records 
  - [How To Add Geology Attributes to a Locality](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Add-Geology-Attributes-to-a-Locality.html)
  - Creating Tweets for BioSci @NMMNHS_Bio (Mollusc Monday, Mammal Monday) and Paleo (Fossil Friday) Twitter feeds and organizing with museum social media
  - Ordering Digitization equipment for taking images. Setting up workstations.
