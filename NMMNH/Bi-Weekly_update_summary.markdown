# NMMNH Digitization Project Completed Bi-Weekly Summary Items

This document lists major tasks completed by the team over the course of the project as reported in the Weekly Meeting notes.

## Progress Report

On Monday, April 13, the production instance of Arctos went down. Covid-19 restrictions meant that tech support from TACC could not access the system until the following day. Repair of the Oracle box is under way. In the mean time, searches could be made on the ArctosPG test version at http://test.arctos.database.museum

On Tuesday, April 28, the production instance of Arctos was restored, but with the last available recoverable back-up from March 15, 2020. Numbers with lines through them represent data before the crash and numbers without a line represent current data.

Total records in Arctos: ~56,760~ 63,336  
Images Taken: 51  
Taxa added to Arctos: ~327~ ?  
Classifications added to Arctos: ~555~ ?  
Publications added to Arctos: ~10~ ?
