# Ideas to plug into new collections digitization grant

* Georeferencing
* Education modules ([Aim-Up](http://aimup.unm.edu/), [BLUE](https://www.biodiversityliteracy.com/))
* Photography
* Community Engagement by connecting specimens with [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/)
* Promotional aesthetic photographs of our specimens
* Updating Collections website
* Use outdoor living collection (garden exhibit) to engage community in digitization project- get community to photograph living specimens and create arctos pages for them- part of social media outreach.
* A series of public programs focused around the digital collections. They would include collections tours. One idea would be to have a photography workshop.
* An exhibit of the best specimen photos of specimens not on exhibit. Each label, in addition to some interpretive text, would have a QR code that links to the specimen's Arctos entry.
