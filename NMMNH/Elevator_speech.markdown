# New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Digitization

## 30 second version

We are digitizing our physical objects by creating high quality digital images and associated descriptive electronic records. Digitization will make our collections accessible to researchers, enthusiasts, constituents, and interested consumers worldwide through searchable online networks. This is accomplished with Arctos, a collaboratively maintained collection data management system that integrates information from all of our disciplines and provides current, web accessible collection data linked with external resources. Arctos’ data standards create more precise and searchable information, allowing us to connect objects, people and places and demonstrate the impact our collection has on science and public knowledge. 

## Two minute version

We are in the process of enhancing our physical objects by creating high quality digital images and recording associated descriptive text to electronic records, otherwise known as digitization. This will allow us to make our collections accessible to researchers, enthusiasts, constituents, and interested consumers worldwide through searchable online networks, facilitating discovery, learning, and enhanced appreciation for the fascinating array of biodiversity resources housed in museum collections. Our mission is to preserve and interpret the distinctive natural and scientific heritage of our state through extraordinary collections, research, exhibits and programs designed to ignite a passion for lifelong learning.  Digitizing our collection is a direct path to fulfilling our mission. 

A recent report funded by the National Science Foundation calls for an Extended Specimen Network  that includes physical specimens and their associated data linked together through various integration systems. Our digitization project includes the transition to Arctos, a collection data management system developed and maintained collaboratively by a consortium of museums and university research collections. Arctos' ability to integrate information from diverse disciplines and provide continuously updated, web accessible data that can be linked with external resources provides us with the ability to make our collections accessible and integrated with other sources and enhances our mission fulfillment while meeting the expectations of the Extended Specimen Network. 

Arctos also places us in a community of practice both locally and worldwide, providing collection and curation staff with access to peers who are also digitizing and working to meet the Extended Specimen Network goals. The data standards built into Arctos mean that our collections’ data will be more precise and searchable. As collection data is improved, we will be able to make connections between objects, people and places and to demonstrate the impact our collection has on science and public knowledge. 

## Why Digitize?

 - "Digitization involves converting physical objects to high quality digital images, associated descriptive text to electronic records, and analog sound and motion recordings to digital representations. The digitization of biodiversity specimens allows museums and academic institutions across the U.S. to make their collections easily available to researchers, enthusiasts, constituents, and interested consumers worldwide through searchable online networks, thus facilitating discovery, learning, and enhanced appreciation for the fascinating array of biodiversity resources housed in US institutions."[1] 
 
 - The mission of The New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science is to preserve and interpret the distinctive natural and scientific heritage of our state through extraordinary collections, research, exhibits and programs designed to ignite a passion for lifelong learning.[2] Digitizing our collection is a direct path to fulfulling our mission. 
 
## Why Arctos?

 - The Biodiversity Collections Network recently released "Extending U.S. Biodiversity Collections to Promote Research and Education". The report calls for an Extended Specimen Network (ESN) that would include the physical specimen and its associated physical and digital, genetic, phenotypic, and environmental data and would rely on integration  mechanisms  necessary  to  link  all  of  the  dynamic  components  together.[4]

- Arctos is a collection data management system developed and maintained collaboratively by a consortium of museums and university research collections.[3] Digitizing with the aid of Arctos places NMMNHS at the forefront of current natural history collection management. Arctos' ability to integrate access to information from diverse disciplines and provide continuously updated, web accessible data that is linked with external resources provides us with the ability to make collections data available to curators, collection managers, investigators, educators, and anyone interested in natural and cultural history enhances our mission fulfillment and meets the expectations of the Extended Specimen Network.

## The Benefits

 - Community - both local and worldwide
 - Access - public data facilitates edu, research
 - We learn more about what we have
