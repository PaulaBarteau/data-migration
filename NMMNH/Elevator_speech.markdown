# New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Digitization

## Why Digitize?

 - "Digitization involves converting physical objects to high quality digital images, associated descriptive text to electronic records, and analog sound and motion recordings to digital representations. The digitization of biodiversity specimens allows museums and academic institutions across the U.S. to make their collections easily available to researchers, enthusiasts, constituents, and interested consumers worldwide through searchable online networks, thus facilitating discovery, learning, and enhanced appreciation for the fascinating array of biodiversity resources housed in US institutions."[1] 
 
 - The mission of The New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science is to preserve and interpret the distinctive natural and scientific heritage of our state through extraordinary collections, research, exhibits and programs designed to ignite a passion for lifelong learning.[2] Digitizing our collection is a direct path to fulfulling our mission. 
 
## Why Arctos?

 - The Biodiversity Collections Network recently released "Extending U.S. Biodiversity Collections to Promote Research and Education". The report calls for an Extended Specimen Network (ESN) that would include the physical specimen and its associated physical and digital, genetic, phenotypic, and environmental data and would rely on integration  mechanisms  necessary  to  link  all  of  the  dynamic  components  together.[4]

- Arctos is a collection data management system developed and maintained collaboratively by a consortium of museums and univerity research collections.[3] Digitizing with the aid of Arctos places NMMNHS at the forefront of current natural history collection management. Arctos' ability to integrate access to information from diverse disciplines and provide continuously updated, web accessible data that is linked with external resources provides us with the ability to make collections data available to curators, collection managers, investigators, educators, and anyone interested in natural and cultural history enhances our mission fulfillment and meets the expectations of the Extended Specimen Netowrk.
