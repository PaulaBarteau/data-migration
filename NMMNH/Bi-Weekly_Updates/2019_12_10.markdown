This documents discussion at weekly team meetings

## Progress Report

Total records in Arctos:  
Total Images Taken: 0

No imaging hardware has been recieved to date.

## Geoscience
### Teresa
**Complete**
 - Wrote [How To Add Geology Attributes to a Locality](http://handbook.arctosdb.org/how_to/How-to-Add-Geology-Attributes-to-a-Locality.html)
 
**In Process**
 - Standardizing Parts
 - Writing data migration documentation.
 - Reviewing names for taxa that are not in Arctos and appear to be invalid per Arctos validation tool. Names added to Arctos to date: 8, Classifications added to Arctos: 25
 - Drafted [elevator talks](https://github.com/ArctosDB/data-migration/blob/master/NMMNH/Elevator_speech.markdown).
 
### Nicole
**Complete**
 
**In Process**

### Hannah
**Complete**
 - 283 taxonomy added to Arctos
 - 2,695 higher geography quad maps compiled

**In Process**
 - Researching for specimen photography protocol
 - Locating unknown paleo parts within the collection to verify part names

 
### Lucius
**In Process**
  - Researching names for taxa that are not in Arctos and do not appear to be valid per Arctos validation tool.
 
## Bioscience
### Teresa
**Complete**

 
### Lindsey
**Complete**


**In Process**
 - Standardizing data on remaining Herbarium records for bulkload to Arctos
 - Working on bulkloading herbarium cat# records 1000-1999
 - Mentoring Paula on bulkloading procedures for the mollusck bulkload
 
### Paula
 **Complete**
 
 
 **In Process**
 - Bird entry complete
 - Creating mollusc bulkload templated and method for bulkloading mollusc records
 - Cleaning up taxon and geography information for entire invertabrate collection
 
## Discussion Topics

### Social Media
Need to document social media strategy
 - Mollusc Monday, Mammal Monday (Paula)
 - Fossil Friday (Hannah)
 
### Tracking Time
It would be good for us to figure out how long it takes to complete specific tasks.
 - Average time to manually enter a single catalog record
 - Average time to research and add a new taxon name to Arctos
 - Average time to add higher geography (map quads) to Arctos
Anything else?
