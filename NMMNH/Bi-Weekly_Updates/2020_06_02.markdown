# NMMNH Digitization Grant 2020-06-02 Weekly Update
(Activity from 2020-05-20 through 2020-06-02)

This documents discussion at bi-weekly team meetings - due to COVID19 and telework, updates will be given weekly.

## Progress Report

Due to the Memorial Day holiday, there was no update given on May 26, 2020.

On Monday, April 13, the production instance of Arctos went down. Covid-19 restrictions meant that tech support from TACC could not access the system until the following day. Repair of the Oracle box is under way. In the mean time, searches could be made on the ArctosPG test version at http://test.arctos.database.museum

On Tuesday, April 28, the production instance of Arctos was restored, but with the last available recoverable back-up from March 15, 2020. Numbers with lines through them represent data before the crash numbers without a line represent current data.

Total records in Arctos: ~56,760~ 65,607  
Images Taken: 51  
Taxa added to Arctos: ~327~ ?  
Classifications added to Arctos: ~555~ ?  
Publications added to Arctos: ~10~ ?
