## Geoscience
### Teresa
**Complete**

 
**In Process**
 - Standardizing Parts
 - Writing data migration documentation.
 - Reviewing names for taxa that are not in Arctos and appear to be invalid per Arctos validation tool. Names added to Arctos to date: 8, Classifications added to Arctos: 25
 - Added 746 basic paleo records (geology needs some correction - awaiting merge of localities L-100_199)
 - Drafted [abstract for SPNHC presentation on private loaclities](https://github.com/ArctosDB/SPNHC/issues/30).
 - Normalized and sent 604 "Site Found By" locality attributes to Arctos DBA for upload
 - Normalized and sent 2,482 "Site Found Date" locality attributes to Arctos DBA for upload
 - Normalized and sent 12,188 "Site Identifier" locality attributes to Arctos DBA for upload
 - Normalized and sent 478 "TRS Aliquot" locality attributes to Arctos DBA for upload
 - Acquired paleo imaging protocols/workflows from Yale Peabody - stored in N:\GeoScience\Arctos\Imaging
 
### Nicole
**Complete**

 
 **In Process**
 - Adding additional accession agents to Arctos. Bulkloading accessions into Arctos. 175 Accessions added this week (these are fossil accessions that are 'empty' right now - no specimen or locality records reference these accessions. As we clean up accessions post-grant, these accessions will likely be filled with existing 'no accession' specimens).
 - Total tally of NMMNHS paleo agents added to Arctos is 746.
 - Reviewing taxon and part data as requested.
 - Researching [formations](https://github.com/ArctosDB/data-migration/issues/175#issuecomment-567642337) that are in MS Access but aren't readily found on line.

### Hannah
**Complete**


**In Process**
 - Researching stratigraphy links using macrostrat
 - Writing abstract for SPNHC presentation. Symposia S8.2. 
 
### Lucius

## Bioscience
### Teresa
**Complete**

 
### Lindsey
**Complete**


**In Process**
 - Fixing remaining arthropod and mammal issues
 - Get mollusc records into bulkload format
 - Getting non-tissued mammal records into Arctos ~450
 - Creating IPM/Arctos abstract for SPNHC
 
### Paula
 **Complete**
 
 
 **In Process**
 - Creating mollusc bulkload templated and method for bulkloading mollusc records
 - Cleaning up taxon and geography information for entire invertabrate collection
 
## Discussion Topics

### SPNHC


#### Open Items
- digitization computers, monitors not here
- photoshop Adobe waiting on the state - probably a month out at least. Get camera software and start taking pics.
- new ethernet Feb 3rd they are working on it now
- no internet for paleo digitization station currently
- Order 3-D printing stuff this week
- Micro CT scanning available from Sandia Labs (Corbin) - need to prioritize and get a list of stuff that would be good for scanning

#### Gila Conference

Hannah and Jason presenting, Teresa going for moral support
