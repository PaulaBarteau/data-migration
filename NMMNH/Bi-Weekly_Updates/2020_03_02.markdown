# NMMNH Digitization Grant 2020-03-02 Bi-weekly Update
(Activity from 2020-02-18 through 2020-03-02)

This documents discussion at bi-weekly team meetings

## Progress Report

Total records in Arctos: 28,594  
Total Images Taken: 15

All imaging hardware has been recieved and is being inventoried and set up. Electricity is a problem in Geoscience.

## Geoscience
### Teresa
**Complete**
 - [Written procedures for creating localities](https://github.com/ArctosDB/data-migration/blob/master/NMMNH/NMMNH_New_Locality.markdown)
 
**In Process**
 - Standardizing Parts
 - Writing data migration protocols
 - Reviewing names for taxa that are not in Arctos and appear to be invalid per Arctos validation tool. Names added to Arctos to date: 8, Classifications added to Arctos: 25
 - Added approx 5,000 basic paleo records
 - Submitted abstract for SPNHC - [Data Management Strategies for the Extended Specimen](https://github.com/ArctosDB/SPNHC/issues/33#issuecomment-586483125)
 - Creating container environment for object tracking.
 - Loan and Project for Hannah's presentation
 - Project for grant - add funding?
 
### Nicole
**Complete**

 
 **In Process**
 - Adding additional accession agents to Arctos. Bulkloading accessions into Arctos. 175 Accessions added this week (these are fossil accessions that are 'empty' right now - no specimen or locality records reference these accessions. As we clean up accessions post-grant, these accessions will likely be filled with existing 'no accession' specimens).
 - Total tally of NMMNHS paleo agents added to Arctos is 746.
 - Reviewing taxon and part data as requested.
 - Researching [formations](https://github.com/ArctosDB/data-migration/issues/175#issuecomment-567642337) that are in MS Access but aren't readily found on line.
 - Submitted abstract for SPNHC - [Adapting Arctos for Paleontology Collections](https://github.com/ArctosDB/SPNHC/issues/37#issuecomment-585845604)

### Hannah
**Complete**


**In Process**
 - Researching stratigraphy links using macrostrat
 - Submitted [abstract for SPNHC](https://github.com/ArctosDB/SPNHC/issues/35)
 - Submitted [Specimen Spotlight](https://github.com/ArctosDB/SPNHC/issues/31#issuecomment-586609361) for SPNHC
 - Preparing presentation for Gila Symposium
 
## Bioscience
### Teresa
**Complete**

 
### Lindsey
**Complete**


**In Process**
 - Fixing remaining arthropod and mammal issues
 - Get mollusc records into bulkload format
 - Fixing mollusc taxonomy problems
 - Getting non-tissued mammal records into Arctos ~450

### Paula
 **Complete**
  - Cleaning up taxon and geography information for entire invertabrate collection
  - Submitted abstract for SPNHC - [Inevitable Interpretations: Locations In Legacy Data](https://github.com/ArctosDB/SPNHC/issues/27#issuecomment-586406081)
 - Submitted [Specimen Spotlight for SPNHC](https://github.com/ArctosDB/SPNHC/issues/31#issuecomment-587505968)
 
 **In Process**
 - Researching digitization and imaging protocols
 - Researching and troubleshooting imaging workflow set up
 - Writing digitization and imaging workflow protocols
 
## Discussion Topics

### SPNHC


#### Open Items
- photoshop Adobe waiting on the state - probably a month out at least. Get camera software and start taking pics.
- new ethernet installed, electricity issue in geosci
- no internet for paleo digitization station currently
- Order 3-D printing stuff this week
- Micro CT scanning available from Sandia Labs (Corbin) - need to prioritize and get a list of stuff that would be good for scanning

#### Gila Conference
