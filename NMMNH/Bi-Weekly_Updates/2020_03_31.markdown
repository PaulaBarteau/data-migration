 - Project for grant - add funding?
 - Currently 2,418 paleo localities have an issue with either higher geography, stratigraphy, or TRS which means that they cannot be loaded completely to Arctos. Issues for everything have been summarized for Nicole.
 
### Nicole

 **In Process**
-Creating bulkload file for new localities and specimens (to date 195 specimens and 260 localities)
-Preparation loan for Arctos
-Working out part names and definitions on Arctos

### Hannah

 - Reading papers on paleo imaging protocols to incorporate relevant information into NMMNHS paleo imaging protocols
 
## Bioscience
### Teresa
**Complete**

## Meeting Discussion Topics

### New Grant Ideas
Review [Ideas Document](https://github.com/ArctosDB/data-migration/blob/master/NMMNH/New%20Grant%20Ideas.markdown)

### Community Engagement

### File Sharing
Use Google Drive for most things, but Dropbox for all Excel files and stuff that needs to maintain a format (forms, etc.)

Dropbox

### SPNHC

Work on presentations - conference has not been canceled.

### COVID19

Keep track of [productivity in GitHub](https://github.com/ArctosDB/data-migration/tree/master/NMMNH/Telework)

#### Open Items
- Micro CT scanning available from Sandia Labs (Corbin) - need to prioritize and get a list of stuff that would be good for scanning
- need velvet and lime green background for photography

#### Notes from last meeting

Need to publish to journals about the project and potentially going forward about collection activity.
Define metadata terms needed in Arctos media and make GitHub requests
