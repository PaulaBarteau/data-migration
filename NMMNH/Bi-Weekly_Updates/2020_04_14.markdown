### Social Media


### COVID19

Keep track of [productivity in GitHub](https://github.com/ArctosDB/data-migration/tree/master/NMMNH/Telework)

#### Open Items
- Micro CT scanning available from Sandia Labs (Corbin) - need to prioritize and get a list of stuff that would be good for scanning
- need velvet and lime green background for photography

#### Notes from last meeting
Need to publish to journals about the project and potentially going forward about collection activity.
Define metadata terms needed in Arctos media and make GitHub requests
