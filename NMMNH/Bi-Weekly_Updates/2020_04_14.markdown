## Geoscience
### Teresa
**Complete**
 - Loaded 4,513 basic records
 - Loaded 5,042 research events
 - Loaded 4,671 parts
 - Reviewed 181 taxon names
 
**In Process**
 - Loading records for localities bulkloaded to Arctos
 - Currently 2,418 paleo localities have an issue with either higher geography, stratigraphy, or TRS which means that they cannot be loaded completely to Arctos. Issues for everything have been summarized for Nicole.
 - Standardizing Parts
 - Writing data migration protocols
 - Submitted abstract for SPNHC - [Data Management Strategies for the Extended Specimen](https://github.com/ArctosDB/SPNHC/issues/33#issuecomment-586483125)
 - Project for grant - add funding?
  
### Nicole

 **In Process**
-Creating bulkload file for new localities and specimens (to date 195 specimens and 260 localities)
-Preparation loan for Arctos

### Hannah
**Complete**
 - 1,200 mineral links compiled

**In Process**

## Meeting Discussion Topics

### New Grant Ideas
Review [Ideas Document](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XIoWyDddDmCqZubPN19NDKZvFQbW0T151vaRyJZQ3bw)

### File Sharing
Use Google Drive for most things, but Dropbox for all Excel files and stuff that needs to maintain a format (forms, etc.)

### SPNHC

Canceled - waiting on instruction from the Foundation.

### Social Media


### COVID19

Keep track of [productivity in GitHub](https://github.com/ArctosDB/data-migration/tree/master/NMMNH/Telework)

#### Open Items
- Micro CT scanning available from Sandia Labs (Corbin) - need to prioritize and get a list of stuff that would be good for scanning
- need velvet and lime green background for photography

#### Notes from last meeting
Need to publish to journals about the project and potentially going forward about collection activity.
Define metadata terms needed in Arctos media and make GitHub requests
